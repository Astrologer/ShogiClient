# ShogiClient
Simple application to play shogi online.<br/>
Starting point - https://astrologer.github.io/ShogiClient <br/>
Be warned that it's rather my scala playground than fully fledged online application. But it's possible play already with some inconvenience like inverted board for white player, missed highlighting and broken indicators
