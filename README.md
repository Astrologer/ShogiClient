# ShogiClient
Simple application to play shogi online. It doesn't require any information from players, just follow the link and it will create a new game and give you two links (one link for each player). <br/>
Starting point - https://astrologer.github.io/ShogiClient <br/>

Be warned that it's rather my scala playground than fully fledged online application. But it's possible play already with some inconvenience like missed highlighting and broken indicators

P.S. Server uses free hosting, it means that it sleeps most of the time and usually requires up to 30 sec to wake so be patient
